NodeJS Simple HTTP Server

This a simple HTTP server made with nodejs.   
I know there's a lot of http server around, and also I should be using some task runner (because that's what cool kids are doing), But I made this one to understande better how nodejs work.

## How to use

For now just copy it and run 

    node server.js

You can also set optional params 

    node server.js --root ROOT_PATH --port PORT
